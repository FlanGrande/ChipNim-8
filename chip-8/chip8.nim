Chip-8 Core

4096KB of memory
Programs start running at 0x200, 0x000-0x1FF is reserved for the interpreter
Some programs start at 0x600

16 general purpose registers V0 to VF
Index register: used to point to memory locations, usually sprites
Program counter: points to the current instruction in memory

The delay timer is active whenever the delay timer register (DT) is non-zero.
This timer does nothing more than subtract 1 from the value of DT at a rate of 60Hz.
When DT reaches 0, it deactivates.

The sound timer is active whenever the sound timer register (ST) is non-zero.
This timer also decrements at a rate of 60Hz, however, as long as ST's value is greater than zero, the Chip-8 buzzer will sound.
When ST reaches zero, the sound timer deactivates.
The sound produced by the Chip-8 interpreter has only one tone.
The frequency of this tone is decided by the author of the interpreter.

All instructions are 2 bytes long and are stored most-significant-byte first.
In memory, the first byte of each instruction should be located at an even addresses.
If a program includes sprite data, it should be padded so any instructions following it will be properly situated in RAM.

nnn or addr - A 12-bit value, the lowest 12 bits of the instruction
n or nibble - A 4-bit value, the lowest 4 bits of the instruction
x - A 4-bit value, the lower 4 bits of the high byte of the instruction
y - A 4-bit value, the upper 4 bits of the low byte of the instruction
kk or byte - An 8-bit value, the lowest 8 bits of the instruction
